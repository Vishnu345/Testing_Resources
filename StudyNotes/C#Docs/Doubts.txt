API automation start.
httpclient in C# (not depend on thiry party, can make our framework)
verbs 
serialization and deserialization
what are model classes and how to use them.
Advantage Rest api multiple clients
phone, tv, ipad, Wrb applications-->rest api--> db

key from one api to another api
key expires in the middle.- find Expires time and at that times we need to 
make a request to token refresh before the access_token has expired
network
FetchXHR, 
authorizations in another class

Exception handling
can ref keyword used for instance methods
is, as and as, typeof is used for runtime type identification.
"as" supports the operation of conversion at runtime without generating the exceptions
The yield return statement returns the next object in the collection, which in this case is the next character in chrs.

Enumerator or Enumerable ==same operation takes place
Importing outer namespace does not import inner namespace in C#
using -- importing namespace using in Exception handling
In case of C#, strings are objects of the built-in string data type.
stack evaluate expressions.
Capacity in ArrayList
Count returns the number of items

Capacity tells the maximum number of items ArrayList can currently hold
Properties can be marked as public, private, protected, internal, protected internal, or private protected. 
from n in nums
                      where n > 0 
                      select Math.Sqrt(n);logical operators===> executes

protected Internal equals -> protected in java
save memory we introduced topic , common , anything that doesn't depend on instance

Abstract classes: not known methods
Rules (Baseclass, child)
interface - I can only have abstract methods, 100% dynamic polymorphism parent= child, 100% multiple inheritance
exception go to exact catch block
switch directly go to exact case block
order of exception - specific to generic
finally cannot return value but try and catch can do
IL - can be executed in any language, using dll
Release - fast, can't be debug
 CLI , nuget is different
